# Packages required to run `scripts/covreport.py`
#
# Notes:
# - `# import: name` specifies the import name of a dependency. It is a directive
#   comment used to verify that all dependencies have been installed.
#   See `scripts/_utils.py`.
# - This file excludes `nobrakes` because it is installed
#   separately from multiple sources in CI (editable/.whl/.tar.gz).
